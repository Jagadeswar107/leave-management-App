# Project Title: Leave Tracker – Employee Leave Management

## Problem Statement
- Employees and managers often face challenges in managing leave requests manually. Employees do not get clear updates on the status of their leave applications, leading to confusion. Managers struggle to track pending approvals, leave balances, and leave trends. HR departments find it difficult to generate accurate reports and monitor leave usage across the organization. There is no centralized system to automate leave requests, approvals, and reporting efficiently.

## Proposed Salesforce Solution

- Employees submit leave requests directly through Salesforce, specifying leave type, dates, and reason.
- Managers receive automated notifications to approve or reject leave requests.
- Salesforce updates leave balances automatically and tracks leave history for each employee.
- Employees receive email notifications when their leave is approved, rejected, or pending.
